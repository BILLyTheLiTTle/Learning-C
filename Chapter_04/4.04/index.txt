Scenario_1 (as defined here "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1433204/how-do-i-use-extern-to-share-variables-between-source-files" by Geremia):
- Create a header file with extern keyword.
- Create c file with the definition.
- Include only the header file and compile all of them together.

Scenario_2 (This scenario is wrong. This is not implemented. Use only Scenario_1 steps.):
- Create a file with extern keyword.
- Create another with the definition.
- Include both into a third and use the variable.

Scenario_3:
- In a file USE a variable at a function.
- After the function DECLARE the variable as extern.
- Then DEFINE it.

Scenario_4:
- In a file DECLARE a variable as extern at a function.
- After the function DEFINE the variable.
 - Then USE it.
