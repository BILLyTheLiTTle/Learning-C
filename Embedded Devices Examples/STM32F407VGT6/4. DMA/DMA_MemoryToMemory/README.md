# DMA_MemoryToMemory

## Learning Outcomes
In this application the target is to:
- Read from Flash and write to SRAM
- Using DMA
- Understand the source/destination increment

## Details
This is a very good example to understand the source/destination incerement. Play with `Increment Address` in `ioc` file and see how the `sramData[]` changes.
