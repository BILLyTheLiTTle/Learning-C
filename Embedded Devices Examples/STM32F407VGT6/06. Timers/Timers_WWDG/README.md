# Timers_WWDG

## Learning Outcomes
In this application the target is to:
- Use on-board LEDs to verify that the WWDG is getting refreshed in time
- Calculate the time to refresh by hand
- Use IRQ functions (`HAL_WWDG_IRQHandler` / `HAL_WWDG_EarlyWakeupCallback`)

## Details
This [tutorial](https://controllerstech.com/iwdg-and-wwdg-in-stm32/) and its [embedded video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AelNsnpfbcM) were very helpful. Video starts with IWDG and at around [8:07](https://youtu.be/AelNsnpfbcM?t=488) it starts talking about WWDG.
