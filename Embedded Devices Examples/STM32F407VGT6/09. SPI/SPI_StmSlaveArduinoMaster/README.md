# SPI_StmSlaveArduinoMaster

## Learning Outcomes
In this application the target is to:
- Communicate STM32 MCU (*slave*) with Arduino (*master*)

## Details
Make sure you connect MOSI &#8594; MOSI, MISO &#8594; MISO, CS &#8594; CS, SCK &#8594; SCK.

## Issues
This example has some problems with the communication with Arduino but the devices seems to exchange a kind of information, which is close to what I expect to!
