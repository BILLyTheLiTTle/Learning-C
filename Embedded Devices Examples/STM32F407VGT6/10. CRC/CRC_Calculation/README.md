# CRC_Calculation
## Learning Outcomes
In this application the target is to:
- Calculate CRC32 on:
  - A single 32-bit value array
  - A single 8-bit value array
  - Two 32-bit values arrays

## Issues
According to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WAtFzkfpLI&ab_channel=STMicroelectronics) the CRC calculation should be no problem for 8-bit values. But according to this example, there is a problem! The problem is explained [here](https://community.st.com/s/question/0D53W00000KGxXHSA1/crc-calculation-for-8bit-values) by the memmbers of ST forum.

Long story short:
>In the first case, you calculate CRC from an array of {0x1A100100, 0xqqqqC0AC, 0xqqqqqqqq, 0xqqqqqqqq, 0xqqqqqqqq, 0xqqqqqqqq}, where qq are whatever bytes happen to be in the memory just after raw_data_8_bit[].
