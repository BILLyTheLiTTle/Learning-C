# UART_DMAInterruptMode

## Learning Outcomes
In this application the target is to:
- UART in interrupt mode with DMA
- Transmit/Receive Callback Functions
- UART Errors

# Issues
According to the book this not seems to be a correct UART Interrupt mode in DMA but it seems that it works as I would like!
