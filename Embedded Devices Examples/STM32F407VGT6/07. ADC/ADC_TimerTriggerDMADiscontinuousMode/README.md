# ADC_TimerTriggerDMADiscontinuousMode

## Learning Outcomes
In this application the target is to:
- Read the same signal (1 voltage divider)
- From 3 different channels (2 channels from the voltage divider, 1 from the direct 3V power source)
- Use a timer as a trigger every 5 seconds
- In Discontinuous mode (1 channel at a time)
- In DMA mode
