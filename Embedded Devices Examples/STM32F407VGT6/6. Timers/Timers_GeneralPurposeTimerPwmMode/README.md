### Description
In this application the target is to:
- Create 4 different PWM pulses from the same timer
- Check the output with a logic analyzer

The CubeMX HSE clock frequency should stick to 8MHz (cuz the HSE is 8MHz) and if you change it, the timer works unpredictable. You can configure the PLL, though!
