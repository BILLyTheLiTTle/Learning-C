### Description
In this application the target is to:
- Create General Purpose Timer in Capture Mode
- Measure the frequency

The CubeMX HSE clock frequency should stick to 8MHz (cuz the HSE is 8MHz) and if you change it, the timer works unpredictable. You can configure the PLL, though!

The frequency is generated by an Arduino. You can validate the frequency of the Arduino by using the Logic Analyzer, without adding an Analyzer!

[This video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de4tfSzXrGM) was a great help.
