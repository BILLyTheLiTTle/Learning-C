Scenario_1 (as defined here "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1433204/how-do-i-use-extern-to-share-variables-between-source-files" by Geremia):
- Create a header file with extern keyword.
- Create c file with the definition.
- Include only the header file and compile all of them together.

Scenario_2 (This scenario is wrong. This is not implemented. Use only Scenario_1 steps.):
- Create a file with extern keyword.
- Create another with the definition.
- Include both into a third and use the variable.

Scenario_3 (It is a bad scenario with compile time errors. See example at Chapter 1.10 for declaring variables (a, c) in a single file.):
- In a file DEFINE/DECLARE two variables at some point.
- Then DECLARE/DEFINE the variables.
- Then USE both.
